Chef and Operators


Ram has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Ram is reading about Relational Operators.
Relational Operators are operators which check relationship between two values. Given two numerical values 
A
 and 
B
 you need to help Ram in finding the relationship between them that is,

First one is greater than second or,
First one is less than second or,
First and second one are equal.
Input Format

First line contains an integer 
T
, which denotes the number of testcases.
Each of the 
T
 lines contain two integers 
A
 and 
B
.

solution - 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // your code goes here
	int T = 0;
	cin >> T;
	for(int i = 0; i < T; i++){
		int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
		cin >> num1 >> num2;
		
		if(num1 > num2){
			cout << ">" << endl;
		}
		else if(num1 < num2){
			cout << "<"<< endl;
		}
		else{
			cout << "="<< endl;
		}
	}
    return 0;
}
